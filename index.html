	<h1>My Super <span class="blink"><em>Ugly</em></span> Webpage</h1>
	<p> Welcome to this amazingly terrible webpage! It captivates a lot of my popular interests within the 1990's...IT'S SO COLORFUL YOU MIGHT THROW UP!!</p>
	<p>Click <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUzslPhNP6M"> here</a> to watch a short clip from "10 Things I Hate About You," one of my favorite late 90's movies which will be the <em> best</em> reciting of Shakespeare's <em>Sonnet 116</em> you will ever hear. I dig the white Rastafarians. "THAT'S RIGHT MON!" </p>
	<p>So if you love this movie as much as I do then you will probably enjoy this scene from Bogey's party!

	<p>Take a look at this <span class="blink"> awesome</span> photo of the members of Nsync posing in Lisa Frank shirts! It's very important to take the time to appreciate that most of them have frosted tips and it can't go unmentioned that JT's pants are <em> intentionally</em> undone. It's called fashion! Ever heard of it? . <img src="./A useless website, but with CSS_files/nsync.jpg" height="355" width="620" alt="nsync in Lisa Frank shirts"></p>
